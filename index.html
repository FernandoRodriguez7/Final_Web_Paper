<h1>Fallout 4: Absurdist and Ironic Humor</h1>

<p>Fallout 4 is an open-world Role Playing Game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic version of Boston, Massachusetts, also referred to as "The Commonwealth" within the game. The core mechanics that defines Fallout 4 include exploration, combat, character building, and having multiple choices to progress through the game. Before I begin to explain the narrative arc and how gameplay plays into it, I must explain the world of Fallout.<br><h2>The Universe of Fallout</h2><br>Fallout is set in an alternate universe where the Cold War never ended. Society remained culturally stuck in the 1950s, along with nuclear families, anti-opposition (typically anti-communist) propoganda and old-fashioned slang, style and music never went out of style. Technology developed differently from our world. Nuclear power replaced most fossil fuels, robots were common household items. Most of Fallout's technology has advanced further than ours except for one key component: microchips. This made their computers bulky and primitive as well as lacking the minuteness of technology we have today. This also means there are no smartphones and no modern internet culture. The game also revolves around a corporation called Vault-Tec which serves asconnection between games since for the majority, start in a Vault-Tec facility.<br><img src="vault-teclogo.png"alt="Vault-Tec Logo" /></p>
