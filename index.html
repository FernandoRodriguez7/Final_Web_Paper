<h1>Fallout 4: Absurdist and Ironic Humor</h1>

<p>Fallout 4 is an open-world Role Playing Game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic version of Boston, Massachusetts, also referred to as "The Commonwealth" within the game. The core mechanics that defines Fallout 4 include exploration, combat, character building, and having multiple choices to progress through the game. Before I begin to explain the narrative arc and how gameplay plays into it, I must explain the world of Fallout.<br>
 <h2>The Universe of Fallout</h2>
 <br>Fallout is set in an alternate universe where the Cold War never ended. Society remained culturally stuck in the 1950s, along with nuclear families, anti-opposition (typically anti-communist) propoganda and old-fashioned slang, style and music never went out of style. Technology developed differently from our world. Nuclear power replaced most fossil fuels, robots were common household items. Most of Fallout's technology has advanced further than ours except for one key component: microchips. This made their computers bulky and primitive as well as lacking the minuteness of technology we have today. This also means there are no smartphones and no modern internet culture. The game also revolves around a corporation called Vault-Tec which serves asconnection between games since for the majority, start in a Vault-Tec facility.

  <h2>Fallout 4 as a Game</h2>
  <p>The world of Fallout 4 fits in perfectly with the way the games mechanics work and yourself as the player. The game starts in a "1905s-esque" suburban neighborhood with nuclear powered vehicles and homes. The player is given the option to play as one of two characters, Nate and Nora. Nate is a United States Army Veteran that fought in a conflict against China in Anchorage, Alaska and has since returned home to be with his wife, Nora, and his infant child, Shaun. Nora worked as an attorney and traveled overseas to do work. Although the game does not change depending on the character you choose to play, the customization adds to the world and helps you make it your own.
   <br><br>The family was a part of a select few pre-approved vault residents for Vault 111, created by Vault-Tec. Moments after choosing your character a news bulletin alerts that a nuclear attack has been commenced in major US cities. At this point during the game I felt as though the world had envoloped me in its universe. This is similar to the "suture" that Silverman explains. There are sirens blaring around you with United States militarized forces mobolizing to the vault to prevent non-residents from going in. Nate's family is let in just at the brink of an nuclear explosion detonating south of the neighborhood.
   
   <br><br> We cut to inside the vault where you and your family along with some neighbors are being processed into the vault while scared and unsure of the future, whether outside of the vault or in. Once processed, you enter a Cryo-Stasis chamber across from your spouse, this chamber will put you into a cryogenic state until permitted by the scientists within the vault or if overrided by an external entity. This is later interupted by a mysterious man that will attempt to kidnap your child from your spouse and unfortunately succeed, ultimately murdering your spouse. After an unknown amount of time you are set free from your chamber. As you exit the vault you see that many of the other chambers failed except for yours and your spouse's. The scientists that once roamed inside the chamber left to nothing but lab coats and bones. The vault works as a tutorial for the player, introducing the exploration mechanics and combat as you face some rather large cockroaches about the size of a domestic cat to about a medium sized dog.
   
   <br><br>The game revolves around the killing of your spouse and the kidnapping of your child. You explore the post-nuclear Wasteland to find out who the man is and who he is connected to. You have many paths to take while exploring as well as many encounters against raiders, wild irradiated and mutated animals, genetically modified humans, humans irradiated into zombies and much more. From varying factions to join and help you track down the mysterious man to different individual companions to help you survive the wasteland.
   
   <br><br>You find out the fact that you were frozen for upwards of 200 years and that the mysterious man's name is Kellogg. You receive help from a humanoid-robot-detective called Nick Valentine and your dog companion, Dogmeat, to track down Kellogg's last known locations. You eventually find Kellogg hidden in a military research facility. You must face him and avenge your family and after defeating him you discover that he is part of a mysterious entity called the Institute. The Institute is comprised of former Commonwealth Institute of Technology associates, a counterpart to what our Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is leading in humanoid robot technology within the United States both within real world and Fallout.
   
   <br><br>The Institute became one of the few organizations to successfully avoid destruction caused by the nuclear war. The Institute focused their efforts to reseach technologies meant to help the Commonwealth recover from the war. Once discovering that Kellogg and the Institute are connected you must find them, however it is quite difficult since many people have heard rumors along with evidence through missing people and humanoid robots that roam the wasteland in place of them.
   
   <br><br>After getting clues that lead you closer and closer to the Institute, you must ultimately side with a faction to help you enter and destroy the organization.
   <br>For this, you have many options:
   <br>The Minutemen - A citizen milita that focuses on protecting settlements and rebuilding the Commonwealth through unity.
   <br>The Brotherhood of Steel - A militarized faction that seeks to control advanced and destructive technologies to prevent misuse.
   <br>The Railroad - A secretive group dedicated to freeing and protecting synthetic life from oppression.
   
   <br><br> Each one of these factions have their own motives and methods for getting into the Institute. Choosing any of these factions will result in the ultimate destruction of the Institute as a whole and depending on which faction you choose can result in the destruction of some of the others.
   <br><br> Once entering the Institute, you encounter a young roughly ten year-old Shaun behind a glass play area. Your character yells for him trying to reach out to him but Shaun seems confused and scared. Shaun does not know your character. After a few more moments of trying to reassure Shaun, a deactivation sequence is announced from the door by an elderly man. Referred to as Father by the game but introduced by himself to the player as Shaun, your once infant child and now leader of the Institute. He explains that the Institute had taken him as he was the only child that was left untainted child in the Commonwealth. The Institute broke into the sealed vault to find Shaun to perfect the humanoid robots known as synths, short for synthetic humanoids. After explaining everything Shaun offers you an alternative to join the Institute and create anew with the Institute.
   <br>The Institute - A secretive underground organization of elite scientists who believe humanity's future depends on technological advancement, even at the cost of ethics and individual freedom.
   
   <br><br>The choice is ultimately up to the player. If the player chooses the former three factions, the player ends the game with "The Nuclear Option" which detonates the nuclear fusion reactor inside the Institute's facility, erradicating the Institute from the Commonwealth. However, if the player chooses to side with the Institute, you help them destroy the disruptive Brotherhood of Steel and Railroad.
   <br><br>After destroying both factions, you speak to Shaun one last time before he passes to then take on his role as leader of the Institute and granting the player the "Nuclear Family" ending.</p>
